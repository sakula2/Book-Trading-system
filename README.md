Project Overview: This is the README file for the Online Book Exchange System, a web platform developed by Sravya Akula CS628 Full Stack Development course at the School of Technology and Computing, MSCS, City University of Seattle.

Abstract:
The Online Book Exchange System is a web platform designed to facilitate the exchange of physical books between users. It offers an inexpensive way for people to exchange books, find out about new books, and obtain new books to read without having to pay. Instead of selling books back for a fraction of the cost, users can participate in a book exchange by agreeing to exchange their book with someone who requests it and receive the book they requested in return. This system encourages the reuse of books, reduces the carbon footprint, and makes book reading more budget-friendly.

Introduction:
In this modern era of e-books, not everyone prefers digital copies. Some people still enjoy reading physical books. The Online Book Exchange System aims to encourage reusability and reduce waste by allowing users to exchange books with one another. This platform provides an efficient way for users to swap books they have read with others, thus allowing their books to find new readers and obtaining new books in return. The platform makes book exchange more accessible and convenient for book lovers.

MERN Stack Overview The Online Book Exchange System is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, which is a full-stack web development framework using JavaScript. Each component in the MERN stack serves a specific purpose: MongoDB: A NoSQL database server that stores data in a binary JSON format and allows easy conversion between clients and servers. Express.js: A server-side JavaScript framework used to build single or multi-page web applications. React: A front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components, making the UI dynamic and interactive. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building fast and scalable network applications. The MERN stack is chosen for its efficiency, speed, ease of use, and the ability to reuse code between the frontend and backend due to the unified JavaScript language.

Requirements Specification:
The functionalities of the Online Book Exchange System include: User registration and login User profile creation and management Adding new books for exchange Searching for available books Purchasing books through point-based transactions

Implementation:
The system's implementation is based on the MERN stack and GraphQL API for data exchange. It follows a client-server architecture, with React-based front-end interacting with the Node.js and Express.js backend, which communicates with the MongoDB database. Apollo GraphQL is used for handling queries and mutations efficiently. The following pages and features are implemented: Home Page: The landing page of the application, providing information about the platform and navigation links to register and log in. Register Page: Allows users to register by providing their name, email, and password. Validates the input data and stores the user information in the MongoDB database. Login Page: Allows registered users to log in with their credentials. Validates the input data and authenticates the user. Profile Page: Once logged in, users can access their profile page to update additional information like address and contact details. The user's profile information is stored in the MongoDB database. Add Book Page: Allows users to create a book post for exchange, including book title, author, genre, ISBN, URL for book image, and pickup address. Users are credited with points upon adding a book post. Books Page: Displays available book posts with details, such as title, author, genre, image, ISBN, and pickup address. Users can purchase books using their points, and the points are deducted from their profile after successful purchases.

Conclusion The Online Book Exchange System provides a user-friendly platform for book lovers to exchange physical books, encouraging reusability and reducing the carbon footprint. The system is built on the efficient MERN stack and features a responsive and interactive user interface.
